 // If ... Else
 
	Kotlin Conditions and If..Else :-
			Kotlin supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:-

					a < b
					a <= b
					a > b
					a >= b
					a == b
					a != b
					
	Kotlin has the following conditionals:-

			Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
			Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
			Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
			Use when to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
