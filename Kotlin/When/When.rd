	// When
	
		/*In Kotlin, when replaces the switch operator of other languages like Java. 
		A certain block of code needs to be executed when some condition is fulfilled. 
		The argument of when expression compares with all the branches one by one until some match is found.
		After the first match is found, 
		it reaches to end of the when block and executes the code next to the when block. 
		Unlike switch cases in Java or any other programming language, 
		we do not require a break statement at the end of each case. 
		In Kotlin, when can be used in two ways: */

			// 1) when as a statement
			// 2) when as an expression 
			
	// Using when as a statement with else
	
		/*when can be used as a statement with or without else branch. 
		If it is used as a statement, 
		the values of all individual branches are compared sequentially with the argument and,
		execute the corresponding branch where the condition matches. 
		If none of the branches is satisfied with the condition then it will execute the else branch.*/
